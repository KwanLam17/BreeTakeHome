# Introduction

Simple application that screens users against the publicly available OFAC SDN list. Check it out here https://bree-takehome-frontend.onrender.com/!

# How it works

1. Provide name, date of birth, and country of user.
2. Hit submit and an alert will show you if the user is a hit or clear (ie. has matching fields or not).
3. A simple table will render displaying the three fields and if they were hits individually.

# How to run locally

1. Run server by running commands `install-server` and then `start-server`.
2. Run client by running commands `install-client` and then `start-client`.
